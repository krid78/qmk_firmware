Krid78's KC60 ISO Layout
========================

This is a layout for a modified KC60. It has basically a ISO layout. Only the ISO return key could not be build.
Therefore, it offers three additional keys, as shown in the picture.

Currently, it offers a basic layer dedicated to Apple Mac. In addition, it has two function layers. One offer additional
key bindings for quick access to hidden and hardly reachable keys. The other one is dedicated to some keyboard
functions.

Yet, it lacks a layer dedicated to the PC.

The aim is to have a PC-Layer, which is mapped like a Mac keyboard.
